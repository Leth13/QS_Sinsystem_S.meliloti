# Quorum-sensing simulation of the Sin system of _Sinorhizobium meliloti_

This project contains three algorythms to simulate on Matlab the quorum sensing Sin system of _Sinorhizobium meliloti_.

## Model

There are a total of 23 reactions characterizing the model.

The transcription and translation reactions were simplified in one reaction with one rate, beta.

## Reaction Rates

The reaction rates are in the parameters.txt file. They were extracted from the data of [Bettenworth et al.](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-30307-6) or, when information was lacking, assumed identical to the simulation of the LuxR/LuxI quorum sensing system of _Vibrio fisheri_ in [Buceta et al.](https://bmcsystbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1752-0509-7-6). If new literature comes out about the actual rates of the _S. meliloti_ species, it's advised to update them.

## Deterministic simulations

The deterministic simulation is based on a set of ODES resolved by the [ODEset solver of Matlab](https://it.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/odeset.html).

myode_full is the wild-type model of the Sin QS system.

myode_expr simulates a mutant lacking the _expr_ gene by setting the internal variable 'DNAexpr = 0'.

## Stochastic simulation

The SSA_QS.m contains the [gillespie style simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillespie_algorithm) for all tot reaction of the Sin QS system.

It needs all 15 reactions rates and the starting number of all metabolite/genes. The internal variable V accounts for the statistical effect of the volume of reaction on one order or superior reactions.

`
  function [SINIplot, SINRplot, EXPRstarplot, EXPRplot, timeplot, meantime] = SSA_QS(y, parameters, numberofcells, numberofreactions)
`

Mutants can be simulated by changing the values of reactions rates.

## Confronting simulations



## Frequency of SinI expression

We used the [peakfinder](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/25500-peakfinder-x0-sel-thresh-extrema-includeendpoints-interpolate) function to calculate the frequency of pulses of expression of SinI.
